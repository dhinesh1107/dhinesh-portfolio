//A project that I worked on towards the end of my Masterâ€™s in History set me on this path of a web developer. The project involved looking at movies on historical themes that could be considered as an educational tool. The website was not the focus of the project, but working on it was such a thrilling experience that a career in this felt like a right fit. Other than this I am a bibliophile, who not just loves reading books but also buying and maintaining a personal library.
